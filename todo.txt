ask about nginx split and differences between prod and lower
    - add ssm_resource to apps module in terraform importable modules which will hold nginx stuff
        - read that in this templater and populate template

update 02/03 files with new children(?)
add activemq logic stuff to template
add docs strings for invoke task param usage    

if there is time, refactor to use a config object so you dont need to pass around is_prod and environements and output dir...

add note about reading secrets at runtime instead of hard coding inside ansible playbook
